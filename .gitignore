# Unity3D generated meta files
# They should not be ignored because Unity uses them to track project settings and assets.
!*.meta

# Firebase specific files (if any)
# Firebase configurations and generated files
# Depending on your setup, Firebase may generate a "google-services.json" (Android) or "GoogleService-Info.plist" (iOS), which should be added to version control as they are essential for the configuration of Firebase services.
# However, ignore other generated Firebase files like:
firebase-debug.log
firebase-config.json
google-services.json
GoogleService-Info.plist

# Build folders or output from Firebase
# If Firebase-related builds or generated files are placed here:
Firebase/
